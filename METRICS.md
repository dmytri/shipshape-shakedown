# Metrics: how to read a shakedown

## The three numbers per leg (bin/mine.sh on the task transcript)

- invocations: model API calls (grouped by message.id). The primary cost driver -
  each re-prefills the whole context (~50-80k cache-read on sonnet legs).
- output tokens: reasoning + report. Small (5-15k/leg); NOT the cost driver.
- wall: first-to-last timestamp. ~95% agent overhead on toy suites, so wall tracks
  invocations x model speed, not verification.

Token cost ~= cache_read x invocations. Latency lever == token lever == fewer rounds.

## Suite executions (bin/runs.sh on the project)

The runlog BeforeAll hook logs every EXECUTING cucumber run (dry-runs excluded - they
run no hooks). Duplicates of the same argv with no intervening tree change = redundancy.
Attribute phases by line ranges (record the count between legs).

## Baselines (2026-07-12, sonnet, tidewatch fixture, doctrine 0.13.x)

| Leg | Invocations | Cache-read | Out | Wall |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Shipwright fit-out (0.13.6) | 36 | 2.95M | 37k | 8.2m |
| Captain (0.13.6) | 13 | 610k | 8.9k | 1.4m |
| Captain (0.13.8, round economy) | ~10 tool uses | - | - | 44s |
| QM + foreground Crew (0.13.6) | 25 (incl 4 wasted polls) | 1.30M | 14k | 3.5m |
| Boatswain custody (0.13.7 table) | 15 | 712k | 10.6k | 2.6m |
| Boatswain custody haiku | 14-16 | ~500-600k | 6-8k | 1.4-2.2m |

Suite executions: fit-out ~8-11; voyage 14 (0.13.3) -> 8 (0.13.6) -> 3 (0.13.8 with
wake run-record: one red classify, one Crew-local, one QM terminal green; custody ran
zero).

Full voyage 0.13.8 (Captain + QM/Crew + fresh-session custody): 35 invocations,
~1.53M cache-read, ~17k out, ~5.6m wall. Same intent on 0.13.3: 15.7m.

## Class tally (impact frequency; update every shakedown)

| Class | Instances | P | N | Neg | Worthiness |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| skill/rigging reads (opening) | 3 | 3 | 0 | 0 | 100 |
| deck retrieval + context reads | 12 | 10 | 2 | 0 | 83 (over-reads of out-of-scope files) |
| owed verification runs | 4 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 100 |
| redundant confirmation runs | 0 | - | - | - | eliminated at 0.13.8 (was the top waste class) |
| polls/waits | 2 | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 (one residual despite foreground order) |
| evidence ops (run record, deck-state hash) | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 | 67 (one unconsumed post-strike recompute) |
| staging/commit/report | 9 | 9 | 0 | 0 | 100 |
| mid-leg doctrine re-read | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 100, but signals a wording gap (spent inference) |

Leg worth densities 0.13.8: Captain ~90%, QM 73%, wake-custody 82%.

## The audit lens (per dk)

Classify EVERY invocation's impact by one objective test - trace whether its output
was consumed:

- POSITIVE: a later invocation or the final artifact demonstrably used it (an edit
  follows a read, a dispatch follows a red list, a commit follows a green, a refusal
  caught a real fault). Record the consumer ("-> #9" or "-> commit").
- NONE: output never referenced again, or it re-established a fact already in
  context/evidence (redundant confirmation runs, re-reads, polls).
- NEGATIVE: output caused a wrong action, rework, or a false conclusion (e.g., the
  watchbill-as-recheck-selector broad run that produced a wrongful refusal).

Per leg report: counts P/N/Neg, and worth density = P-tokens / total cache_read.
Class worthiness accumulates across shakedowns: for each invocation class (skill read,
deck retrieval, owed run, hygiene check, confirmation run, poll...), worthiness =
(positives - negatives) / instances, i.e. "out of 100 runs of this class, how often
did it have positive impact." Classes trending under ~50 are merge or eliminate
candidates; a doctrine change is cost-validated when its target class's frequency
rises. Keep the class tally in this file under Baselines.

For each invocation also ask: mergeable into another invocation, another
job, another role? Known classes: opening reads (batchable), independent hygiene checks
(batchable), polling waits (eliminate - foreground spawns), discover+step-usage (one
run serves both, 0.13.8), custody reruns of caller-proven greens (inherit - decision
table row 1 / wake record).
